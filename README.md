# Pawn Island Academy Web Platform

## Overview
This project is an experimental full stack web development platform designed to learn and implement industry best practices. It is a modern version of the Pawn Island Academy website that now includes a whitelabeled merch store and appointment booking app integrated into a single platform.

## Objectives
- **Learning Best Practices:** Gain theoretical knowledge in full stack development using modern technologies.
- **Scalability & Maintainability:** Build a solid codebase that adheres to best practices in architecture and design.
- **Modularity:** Develop separate but integrated components for:
    - A whitelabeled merch store.
    - An appointment booking system.
- **User Experience:** Deliver a seamless user experience by integrating diverse features in one unified platform.

## Features
- **Full Stack Architecture:** End-to-end solution covering the front end, backend, and database management.
- **Whitelabeled Merch Store:** 
    - Customizable for different brands.
    - Secure checkout and product management.
- **Appointment Booking App:**
    - Calendar integration.
    - Real-time availability updates.
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-friendly and accessible UI/UX.
- **Theoretical Insights:** Documentation of best practices and design decisions.

## Technologies
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (and modern frameworks/library suggestions such as React or Vue.js)
- **Backend:** Node.js, Python (Django or Flask), Ruby on Rails or similar
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, or NoSQL alternatives (MongoDB)
- **Additional Tools:** API integration, authentication methods, and payment gateway support for the merch store
